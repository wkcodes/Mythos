## Application Overview
This is a React based application that utilizes axios to make calls to our sql database. Users are able to sign up, log in, make posts, create and edit an avatar, and see the posts of other users. 

## Future development
In the future we would like to include the following: 
1) Implement user authentication 
2) Ways for users to have their real world experiences impact their Mythos character statistics. 
3) Create a "mad-libs" type myth maker to help users create and develop stories for their characters.
4) Geo-caching treasure hunting with mythos planted "loot."
